# Battery-Thermal-Runaway-Analysis
This project is derived from the works of Richard and Dahn, [1999a](http://dx.doi.org/10.1149/1.1391893) and [1999b](http://dx.doi.org/10.1149/1.1391894) models the equations described in the paper under the following scenarios in an attempt to understand the effects electrolyte formation, initial amounts of intercalated Lithuium, the surface area of MesoCarbon MicroBeads (MCMB) and initial temperature. Additionally, methods of mitigation of battery self-heating effects were also considered in **Scenario 4**.

**Scenario 1:** Estimate the self-heating rate profile for different reaction
orders; the calculation is based on Eq. 1 and 7b, where $\frac{h_1}{C} = 150 \degree C$, $E_1 = 1.4$ eV, $A_1 = 1 \times 1017$ min-1, and
$x_{fo} = 0.10$. Additionally, please comment on how you expect the self-heating rate profile to change with a
different electrolyte formulation (e.g. different EC:DEC ratios such as 33:67 or LiBF4 in EC:DEC).

**Scenario 2:** Estimate the self-heating rate profiles for low-surface area
MCMB with different amounts of intercalated Li, showing the self-heating rate profiles calculated based
on Eq. 7b, the change in the amount of intercalated Li, the change in the amount of metastable SEI
components, and the growth of the SEI layer.

**Scenario 3:** Show the difference between the low- and high- surface-area
MCMB calculated using both Eq. 7a and 7b. Comment on the advantages and disadvantages of selecting
a low- vs high- surface-area electrode.

**Scenario 4:** Provide one feasible alternative (supported by calculations) to mitigate self-heating,
“maintaining” the sample temperature at 30 °C (for example with liquid or air cooling).

**Scenario 5:** Run a sensitivity analysis, for scenario 1 or 3. Investigate multiple steady state conditions and
their effect on self-heating rates. (Simulate the effect of changes on input variables, such as $\frac{h_1}{C}$, $A_1$, $E_1$, $n$
and $\frac{h_2}{C}$, $A_2$, $E_2$, $m$ and different amounts of intercalated Li and/or different initial heating temperatures,
on output variables, such as self-heating rates.)

**Bonus:** Show the self-heating rate profiles for lithium cells heated
to 80, 100, and 115°C.
